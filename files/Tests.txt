1. Check if suppliers offering semantically equivalent processes (e.g. PlungeEDM) are considered equally as syntactically equivalent processes.
2. Validation of missing processes, materials, attributes, certifications in RFQ JSON
3. Supplier processes perfectly aligned with RFQ JSON should have sim score 1.0
4. Check if super concepts and sub concepts are included (e.g. EndMilling-Milling scenario from Lugano)
5. Check influence of attribute weight, material weight, certification weight. Do the current weight values make sense?
6. Check results weighted vs unweighted matching
